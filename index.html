                <p>
                    The first thing we need to do for any Unity project is...install Unity!  Now that 2019 has an LTS version I've switched over, and that's what we'll be using in this tutorial.  You can install it from the Unity Hub.

                <p>
                    Once you've installed Unity, we'll need to get Photon.  From the <code>Window</code> menu open up the <code>Asset Store</code> and search for <code>Photon Voice 2</code>.  The asset package for voice actually has Voice, Chat, and PUN included so that's all we need.  When Photon pops up a window asking for an App ID just select Skip and Close, we'll do that next.

                <h3 class="title is-3">Step 3 - Setup Photon Apps</h3>
                <p>
                    Now we need to create our Photon apps and get our App IDs.  Head over to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.photonengine.com/en-US/Photon">Photon</a> and create an account, and go to the Dashboard.  You'll need to create three apps.  One each for Chat, PUN2, and Voice2.  Once that's done head back into Unity, open the <code>Window</code> menu and select <code>Photon Unity Networking => Highlight Server Settings</code>.  Alternatively you can use the keyboard shortcut <code>Ctrl-Alt-Shift-P</code> to open the Server Settings.  Copy all your App IDs into their respective fields, and set the App Version to whatever.  Important note about the app version: as you continue developing your app and making changes, and updating your app version, your players will only be able to join games with other players using a game with the same version.  So a player using version 1.3 won't be able to join with another using 1.4, or even 1.31.

                <p>
                    Yup, I know what you're thinking:  why are we worried about ScriptableObjects and Events in a multiplayer tutorial?  Well, if you aren't aware of the powers of combining these two things get ready!  Our project will mainly consist of two types of GameObjects:  one that has code that tells Photon to do something, and another that has code that lets the user tell it to do something.  What we want to avoid is having our user interact with UI that directly tells our game to do something.  This is a concept that has been gone over and over again in tons of places on the internet, and if you want to learn more you absolutely should.  Look into Event-Driven UI, or Decoupled UI.  This isn't a tutorial about those things, but we will be using them.  Eventually I plan to convert all this over to work in VR, and for that we ideally will have a completely different UI.  If I create all my UI and network logic together now I'll be repeating myself when I make a new UI.  That's bad.  Don't write the same code twice.
                </p>
				<p>Alright, let's get to some code.  Make a new folder in your <code>Assets</code> folder called <code>SO_Events</code>.  In this folder you'll make two scripts, <code>GameEvent.cs</code> and <code>GameEventListener.cs</code>.</p>
				<div class="codeblock">
					<pre>
						<code>
// GameEvent.cs

using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections.Generic;

[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "GameEvent", menuName = "GameEvent")]
public class GameEvent : ScriptableObject
{
    private List&lt;GameEventListener> listeners = new List&lt;GameEventListener>();

    public void Raise()
    {
        for (int i = listeners.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        {
            listeners[i].OnEventRaised();
        }
    }

    public void AddListener(GameEventListener listener)
    {
        listeners.Add(listener);
    }

    public void RemoveListener(GameEventListener listener)
    {
        listeners.Remove(listener);
    }
}
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<div class="codeblock">
					<pre>
						<code>
// GameEventListener.cs

using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Events;

public class GameEventListener : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private GameEvent gameEvent;
    [SerializeField] private UnityEvent responseEvent;

    private void OnEnable()
    {
        gameEvent.AddListener(this);
    }

    private void OnDisable()
    {
        gameEvent.RemoveListener(this);
    }

    public void OnEventRaised()
    {
        responseEvent.Invoke();
    }
}
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>As mentioned before, this isn't going to be a ScriptableObject Event tutorial, but let's go through this code a little.  There isn't much to it so it won't take long.  Starting with <code>GameEvent.cs</code> right at the top we have an attribute, <code>CreateAssetMenu</code>.  This allows you to create a new GameEvent in your project by right-clicking in the Asset folder and selecting <code>Create => GameEvent</code>. Next, let's look at <code>AddListener</code> and <code>RemoveListener</code>.  These two public methods allow a GameEventListener to tell this GameEvent that it needs to be notified (or no longer notified) when the GameEvent is Raised.  Last, there is <code>OnEventRaised</code> that loops over all of the GameEventListeners that have told this GameEvent they want to know about it and tells them it's been Raised.  We loop over in descending order so that any GameEventListeners that may fire once and then remove themselves won't mess up the remaining order of the others in the List.  When the GameEvent is Raised it triggers a UnityEvent that can then be set and handled in the editor.  There is a lot of possibility with these GameEvents, but we'll barely be using any of it.  We just need an Event we can create in our project and link to a UnityEvent.

        </div>

	<section class="section" id="network_manager">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="content">
                <h3 class="title is-3">Step 5 - CustomNetworkManager</h3>
                <p>Good game architecture would argue that having a Manager, which is generally a singleton, is a bad idea.  In this case we need something to keep track of our PUN information, so we will go with a Manager.  The script won't be of an overwhelming size so I think it's okay here.  I'd love to hear your thoughts on how to architect this differently.</p>
				<p>Make a new script called <code>CustomNetworkManager.cs</code>.  This one will be bigger, so we'll do it in stages. The first change is to set our script to inherit from <code>MonoBehaviourPunCallbacks</code>.  This will allow us to override some methods to get notified when various Photon events happen.  Also, we need our Manager to be a singleton so let's get that setup. </p>
				<div class="codeblock">
	                <pre>
						<code>
using Photon.Pun;
using Photon.Realtime;
using UnityEngine;

public class CustomNetworkManager : MonoBehaviourPunCallbacks
{
	public static CustomNetworkManager instance;

	private void Awake()
	{
	    if (instance == null)
	    {
	        instance = this;
	    }
	    else
	    {
	        Destroy(gameObject);
	    }
	}
}
						</code>
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>So what happens now, if you aren't aware of how singletons work, is that when our game starts and <code>Awake</code> is called our Manager will check to see if the reference to itself, <code>instance</code>, exists or not.  We only ever want one of these to exist, and we want that instance available from anywhere, so we set it with the accessors <code>public static</code>.  In our Awake method if instance is null we will set instance to reference this specific script on this GameObject in our game.  If instance is not null, which means a GameObject with this script already exists in our game, we destroy this one.</p>


				<h3 class="subtitle">PUN Callbacks</h3>
				<p>We want our Manager to be notified when certain things happen.  To acheive this we will override some callbacks added with <code>MonoBehaviourPunCallbacks</code>.  In the code below I have added some comments to explain what they do, and I created a new variable <code>printDebug</code> so we can easily toggle having these events print a message in our editor console.  It seems like there are a lot of things here, but they are all pretty simple.  Generally there is a success and a failure event for a network task.</p>
